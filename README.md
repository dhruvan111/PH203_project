# Calculation of Throughput and pumping speed in a Vacuum Chamber
This project aims to determine how to calculate throughput and pumping speed using various parameters. To implement this, a web application interface is being deployed as well as two different programs for their calculation, namely the gas equation and the pumping speed formula.
